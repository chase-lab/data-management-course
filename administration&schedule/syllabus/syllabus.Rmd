## Spatial data
 - GIS metadata: Coordinate systems, projections, z, ...?
 - Tools (to guess, to convert between projections)

## Version control
 - just an introduction?
 - more, in relation with the IT git class?
 - Emma's intro on Tools for collaboration
 - branching (master, devel)
 - pull requests
 - good practices
 - when to commit?

 - thinking of the possibility of having an hour breakout for students who are not familiar with git at all.

Who? on what day? for how long?

## Workflow
 - The horror story
 - What to think about when planning?
 - of interest for all languages, don't be R specific before getting to the hands on.
 - never use Excel for data manipulation. The date format nightmare.
 - how to document? (R comments to function documentation, readme, DESCRIPTION) (so obvious in industry)
 - part 1 preparing a rstudio notebook as an introduction. Using published bad open access data sets to illustrate vs. a great open access.
 - part 2 user's own data but having an example data set just in case. (we might be talking to students who have not be on the field yet / have no data yet)
 - open access workflow examples. Don't be ashamed of your code!
 - when splitting your code into several scrips?
 - introduction to drake with the learn drake package  

Alban - 3-4 hours

## Introduction to database:
 - what is a relational database?
 - why?
 - Structure? fore reliability, for readability, reproducibility, archiving, FAIR, speed, weight

Who? on what day? for how long?  

## Introduction to iDiv data repository (Ani)
 - What is good open data metadata
 - Naming variables in a meaningful way
 - Open formats
 
Who? on what day? for how long?  

## Horror Card Game
Ice-breaker:
A (~role playing) card game with lost/corrupted/unclear data set situations to explore and solve. Such as having to run analyses again the day before your defense and data is missing.  
Practical  
Social  
English and German  
Used to 'scare' them to make them realise how bad it can get  

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
