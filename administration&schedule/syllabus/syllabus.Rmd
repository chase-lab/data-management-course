## Workflow
 - What to think about when planning?
 - of interest for all languages, don't be R specific before getting to the hands on.
 - never use Excel for data manipulation
 - how to document? (R comments to function documentation, readme, DESCRIPTION) (so obvious in industry)
 - part1 preparing a rstudio notebook as an introduction. Using published bad open access data sets to illustrate vs. a great open access.
 - part 2 user's own data but having an example data set just in case. (we might be talking to students who have not be on the field yet / have no data yet)
 - open access workflow examples. Don't be ashamed of your code!
 - when splitting your code into several scrips?
 - introduction to drake with the learn drake package

Used to 'scare' them to make them realise how bad it can get  

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
